Basic Font Information
--------------------------

Redaction is a bespoke typeface commissioned by Titus Kaphar and Reginald Dwayne Bettsâ€™ The Redaction exhibition at MoMA PS1. As part of a timely conversation at the intersection of history, the legal system and social justice, the fonts will be free for personal use and commercial use. In a spirit of generosity, the artists invite everyone to broaden the ethos of the exhibition by making these tools accessible to a global and engaged audience. 

110 inclusives glyphs has been added to this font by Marie Godefroy for the first issue of Curseurs, thanks to the guide of Bye Bye Binary on gitlab.com/bye-bye-binary and https://typotheque.genderfluid.space/quni.html
